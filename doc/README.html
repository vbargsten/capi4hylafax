  <H2><A NAME="1"></A>1 General Information about Fax G3 over the CAPI 2.0 Interface with AVM ISDN-Controllers</H2>

     <P>Analog Fax G3 service over the digital ISDN network requires that the data transmitted be transformed from analog to digital or from digital to analog (A/D or D/A transformation), as well as signaling conform to the Fax G3 standard (such as ITU-T.30).</P>

     <P>As part of the CAPI 2.0 standard, this protocol mechanism is subject to compulsory standardization (TB.30 modem for Group 3 fax). The implementation of this protocol by the manufacturer of the ISDN-Controller is optional. If Fax G3 is implemented in CAPI 2.0 drivers, software developed for the CAPI 2.0 interface can access the ISDN-Controller directly and thus quite easily. All AVM ISDN-Controllers for ISDN basic access currently supported by CAPI4Linux offer Fax&nbsp;G3 support over the CAPI 2.0 interface.</P>

     <P>Note that when passive ISDN-Controllers like the AVM FRITZ!Card are used, all calculations for A/D or D/A transformation must be carried by the CPU of your computer system. This can result in a relatively high system load, especially when Fax&nbsp;G3 documents are received. Active controllers such as those from the AVM ISDN-Controller Family B1 all include their own chip, thus reducing the system's load.</P>

     <P><A HREF="#Inhalt">Back to top</A></P>

  <H3><A NAME="1.1"></A>1.1 HylaFAX and Connecting to ISDN Using CAPI 2.0</H3>

     <P>The current version of HylaFAX unfortunately does not offer direct CAPI 2.0 binding; only a binding for analog modems. Until now only active ISDN-Controllers like the AVM ISDN-Controller B1 could be connected to HylaFAX by patch.</P>

     <P>This &quot;CAPI4Linux&quot; package allows the use of practically any ISDN-Controller equipped with a fax-capable CAPI 2.0 driver compliant with the LINUX CAPI 2.0 specification. See also the CAPI 2.0 Specification at:<BR> <A HREF="http://www.capi.org">http://www.capi.org</A></P>

     <P>Thus it is possible to fax with the popular passive ISDN-Controllers even in Linux. Thanks to CAPI 2.0, multiple ISDN services can be used at the same time, such as Fax&nbsp;G3 reception and a connection to the Internet via pppd. The ISDN B channels are assigned automatically by the CAPI 2.0 driver.</P>

     <P>Up to four active AVM ISDN-Controllers with CAPI4Linux drivers can be installed on each system. Even mixed configurations are possible (for instance, one AVM ISDN-Controller B1 ISA plus two ISDN-Controllers C2). The CAPI4HylaFAX module then has to be modified for operation with multiple ISDN-Controllers. Please see the additional information in <A HREF="#3">section 3</A>.</P>

     <P>In any system, only <B>one passive ISDN-Controller</B> (e.g. FRITZ!Card PCI) can be installed using a CAPI4Linux driver.</P>

     <P>The latest version of HylaFAX and more information are available at <br><A HREF="http://www.hylafax.org">http://www.hylafax.org</A>.</P>

  <H3><A NAME="1.2"></A>1.2 Important Information for the Installation of the HylaFAX Interface for CAPI 2.0</H3>

     <P>From the current HylaFAX version on (included on the SUSE 8.1 CDs), HylaFAX always transfers seven parameters to HylaFAX faxrcvd. SUSE Linux versions 8.0 or below or original HylaFAX versions expect fewer parameters. The difference from the original HylaFAX lies in the restricted analog model of the former, which does not include the important interpretation of the ISDN feature MSN or DDI for e-mail forwarding.</P>

     <P>The new CAPI4HylaFAX installation script automatically changes an existing faxrcvd script so that older faxrcvd scripts can continue working with the current CAPI4HylaFAX version.</P>

     <P>In line 33, for example, the script looks like this:</P>

     <P># faxrcvd file devID commID error-msg CIDNumber CIDName destination<BR> #<BR> <B>if [ $# <FONT COLOR="#008040">-lt</FONT> 7 ]; then</B><BR> echo &quot;Usage: $0 file devID commID error-msg CIDNumber CIDName destination&quot;<BR> fi</P>

     <P>The following table specifies the faxrcvd parameters in brief:</P>

If for some reason the file does not exist (any more), the default settings will be used automatically. In order to move this configuration file to another position in the system, the location must be entered using the command to open the application, &quot;-C FILE&quot;.

     At this junction a quick test in stand-alone operation can be performed, since no other components are required by HylaFAX. Send or receive a fax from the command line using the two applications below:

     In stand-alone operation without HylaFAX &quot;c2faxrecv&quot; cannot be running when a fax is to be sent. &quot;c2faxsend&quot; can use only the &quot;TIFF&quot; (class F, FAX G3, 1 dim. Huffmann coding) and &quot;SFF&quot; file formats. In order to send a document, it should be converted with a corresponding program first (e.g. with Ghostscript). AVM supplies the demonstration file &quot;fritz_pic.tif&quot; in a suitable TIFF format. The command for sending the AVM test fax to any Fax G3 remote site, specified with [TelNo], is thus

  <H4><A NAME="2.3"></A>2.3 Working in HylaFAX</H4>

     <P>To work with HylaFAX, a number of preparatory steps are performed automatically by the installation script during installation (see the section &quot;<A HREF="#2.2">Installation</A>&quot;, step 5).</P>

     <P>If HylaFAX is to be used, note the following:</P>
       <UL>
         <LI>The &quot;./install&quot; script executed during installation copies the fax files to &quot;/usr/local/bin&quot;.</LI>
         <LI>The system searches for HylaFAX automatically. The HylaFAX &quot;config file&quot; and the &quot;/etc/inittab&quot; file are modified as necessary so that faxes can be sent and received over CAPI 2.0.</LI>
         <LI>Faxes can only be sent and received with HylaFAX when &quot;c2faxrecv&quot; is active. Therefore this program was registered automatically in the &quot;/etc/inittab&quot; file.</LI>
         <li>Read and write rights (rw) to &quot;/dev/capi20&quot; must be configured for the fax user(s) in &quot;dev/capi20&quot; and &quot;/var/spool/hylafax&quot; or &quot;/var/spool/fax&quot;, which is generally not the case. When &quot;root&quot; runs &quot;c2faxrecv&quot;, &quot;c2faxrecv&quot; changes the user &quot;root&quot; to &quot;fax&quot; which is member of the group &quot;dialout&quot;. To grant &quot;user access&quot; to CAPI&nbsp;2.0, the rights in &quot;/dev/capi20&quot; and &quot;/var/spool/hylafax&quot; or &quot;/var/spool/fax&quot; must be changed to &quot;0666&quot;.</li>
         <LI>To avoid rebooting, simply activate &quot;c2faxrecv &amp;&quot; after installation. In some cases it is necessary to end the HylaFAX program &quot;faxq&quot; and to restart it in order to implement the changes to the settings in its configuration file.</LI>
       </UL>

     <P><A HREF="#Inhalt">Back to top</A></P>

  <H4><A NAME="2.4"></A>2.4 Sending Faxes with HylaFAX</H4>

     <P>To send, just enter &quot;sendfax -d [TelNo] file&quot;. The file can have almost any format. The programs &quot;file&quot; or &quot;a2ps&quot; must be able to read the format so that the file can be converted correctly first into PS format and then into TIFF format. Graphic frontends are also available to make working with HylaFAX somewhat easier. For more information, see the documentation at:</P>

     <P><A HREF="http://www.hylafax.org/">http://www.hylafax.org</A></P>

     <P>If faxes are to be sent directly from an application, the printer configuration must be adapted in the application. Usually a command for printing can be entered in the application, usually just &quot;lpr&quot;. Replace this with &quot;sendfax -d [TelNo]&quot;. These functions are program-dependent and should be documented in the application Help file.</P>

  <H4><A NAME="2.6"></A>2.6 Additional Instructions</H4>

      <UL>
        <LI>The &quot;config file&quot; must be located in the &quot;etc&quot; directory of HylaFAX.</LI>
        <LI>Even if faxes are only to be sent, &quot;c2faxrecv&quot; must be active!</LI>
        <LI>For fax reception, simply run &quot;c2faxrecv &amp;&quot;, for instance in a start scrpt, if it has not already been run in &quot;etc/inittab&quot;.</LI>
        <LI>&quot;Device&quot; Name: Because the applications are CAPI 2.0 applications based directly on CAPI, this entry is not actually necessary. However, the name of the device can be entered in the commando line, or is entered automatically by HylaFAX. This name is used only for signaling to HylaFAX and to determine the name of the configuration file: &quot;config.[Device Name]&quot;. Thus it is also possible to manage multiple &quot;c2faxrecv&quot; demons along with their configuration files. Another option is the "-C" switch.</LI>
        <LI>If problems occur after installation during fax transmission, HylaFAX probably did not yet process the modifications in the configuration file correctly. In this case, entering &quot;faxsetup&quot; or &quot;faxmodem faxCAPI&quot; manually with &quot;root&quot; or superuser rights can be used to implement the changes in HylaFAX.</LI>
        <LI>For comprehensive logging, delete in canfig.faxCAPI the &quot;#&quot; preceding the &quot;LogTraceLevel:4&quot; entry. The log file is saved by default to &quot;/var/log/capifax.log&quot;.</LI>

  <H2><A NAME="3"></A>3 Installing the HylaFAX Interface for CAPI 2.0 in Other Distributions</H2>

     <P>Even if you use any distributions or kernel versions other then SUSE, it is usually no problem to use CAPI4HylaFAX. Only if the installation routine of CAPI4HylaFAX reports missing (program) libraries is it necessary to compile the sources supplied in the directory &quot;/src&quot;. To simplify this process, AVM supplies complete &quot;makefiles&quot;. For more details about compiling sources, see the file &quot;README.src&quot;.</P>

  <H2><A NAME="4"></A>Instructions about the File Format and on Converting Existing Files</H2>

     <P>TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) files must correspond to the specification &quot;Class F for facsimile (TIFF Class F)&quot;, based on the TIFF&nbsp;6.0 specification. In addition, the file must contain one-dimensional Huffmann coding. This format was specified in &quot;Group&nbsp;3&quot; by the CCITT (International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee). For more information about TIFF format, see the &quot;Developer&quot; division of Adobe Systems Incorporated at: <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com">http://www.adobe.com</A></P>

  <H4>Converting Existing Files with Ghostscript</H4>

     <P>To convert a postscript file into a TIFF file conform to the fax application, the following command can be used to activate Ghostscript:</P>
     <BLOCKQUOTE>

     <P><B STYLE="font-weight: bold;">gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=tiffg3 -sOutputFile=[Name of tiff file] [Name of postscript file]</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

     More information about the SSF format is documented in the CAPI&nbsp;2.0 specification at <a href="http://www.capi.org">http://www.capi.org</a>.

  <H2><A NAME="5"></A>5 Instructions for Operation with Multiple AVM ISDN-Controllers</H2>

     <P>Up to four active AVM ISDN-Controllers can be addressed via the CAPI 2.0 interface. It is also possible to install controllers for different bus systems such as PCI, ISA and PCMCIA. For details about the controller installation, please refer to the documentation of the driver module Linux CAPI 2.0.</P>

     <P>The module CAPI4HylaFAX simultaneously supports the operation of multiple active AVM ISDN-Controllers sending and receiving in HylaFAX. After installing the module CAPI4HylaFAX, some modifications are necessary in the configuration file &quot;/etc/config.faxCAPI&quot;. This is necessary because the graphic installation routine described above is designed for one controller only. Other parameters for the operation of several AVM ISDN-Controllers in the configuration file &quot;config.faxCAPI&quot; are documented in the file itself. After modifying the configuration file the module &quot;c2faxrecv&quot; must be stopped and restarted in order to activate the modification.</P>

     <P>A pre-configured sample script is enclosed for the operation with the AVM ISDN-Controller&nbsp;C4 or the AVM ISDN-Controller&nbsp;C2. The script is called &quot;sample_AVMC4_config.faxCAPI&quot;. This script simplifies the configuration of multiple-channel controllers for CAPI4HylaFAX: just modify the script according to your individual technical surroundings (MSNs etc.).</P>

  <H2><A NAME="6"></A>6 Instructions for Fax Polling</H2>

     <P>Fax polling is now supported with this version of HylaFAX. Operation in client mode is possible, i.e., CAPI4HylaFAX can be used to poll fax documents. It is not yet possible to provide callers with fax documents to poll (Server Mode).</P>

     <P>Execute the following file to start fax polling in stand-alone mode:</P>
     <BLOCKQUOTE>

     <P><B STYLE="font-weight: bold;">c2faxsend -vf TIFF -d [TELNo] -P [e-mail address]</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

     <P>Execute the following file to start fax polling in HylaFAX mode:</P>
     <BLOCKQUOTE>

     <P><B STYLE="font-weight: bold;">sendfax -d [TELNo] -p</B></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

     <P>In either case, a script is started after the fax is received and the e-mail address and the corresponding fax document is provided. The script is defined in the configuration file &quot;config.faxCAPI&quot; under the following parameter:</P>
